# Update 01-17-2019
We recognized alignment errors in a few pieces which are caused by
problems with Lilypond (in particular with pieces containing "Da capos").
The problem usually effected the alignment towards the end of a piece.
Unfortunately, this is hard to detect and therefore also to fix automatically
as Lilypond has no general rule how "Da capos" are encoded.
Therefore, we decided to remove these pieces from the dataset.
We updated all splits files accordingly.
You can still find the original split files in the branch "tismir2018".

The effected pieces (12 out of 479) are listed below:
